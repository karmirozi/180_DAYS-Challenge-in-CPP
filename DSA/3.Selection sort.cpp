// arranging anything in order is sorting example dictionary with sorting it's easy to find thing's
// example we have array with some data and you are told to sort we need to put data in ascending or descending order there are multiple technique to do it

    // in 3rd round/pass at index i = 2 put min value in array there with swap
    // in 4th round/pass at index i = 3 put min value in array there with swap
    // in (n-1)th round/pass at index i = n-2 put min value in array there with swap
